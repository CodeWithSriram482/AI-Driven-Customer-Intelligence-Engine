AI-Driven Customer Intelligence Engine
📌 Project Overview

This project builds an AI-driven customer intelligence system to segment retail customers based on behavioral and financial attributes. Using clustering techniques, the model identifies distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing, revenue optimization, and strategic decision-making.

🎯 Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to understand diverse customer purchasing behaviors across varying income levels and spending patterns. Without structured segmentation, marketing efforts become generic and inefficient. This project transforms raw customer data into meaningful behavioral segments to support data-driven business strategies.
